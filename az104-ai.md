### Week 1 Quiz: Manage Azure Identities and Governance

#### Day 1: Introduction to Azure AD
1. **What is the primary purpose of Azure Active Directory?**  
   - [ ] Data storage  
   - [ ] Identity and access management  
   - [ ] Network security  
   - [ ] Virtual machine deployment  

2. **Which of these is an authentication method supported by Azure AD?**  
   - [ ] Passwordless authentication  
   - [ ] Shared Access Signatures (SAS)  
   - [ ] Azure Key Vault  
   - [ ] Azure Resource Manager  

3. **What is Conditional Access in Azure AD?**  
   - [ ] A way to monitor resource health  
   - [ ] A tool for resource access policies based on conditions  
   - [ ] A virtual machine security option  
   - [ ] An identity synchronization tool  

#### Day 2: Manage Users and Groups
1. **How can you assign a user to a role in Azure AD?**  
   - [ ] Through Azure CLI only  
   - [ ] Using the Azure AD Portal, PowerShell, or CLI  
   - [ ] By enabling Conditional Access  
   - [ ] By configuring resource locks  

2. **What is the primary purpose of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?**  
   - [ ] To encrypt data in storage  
   - [ ] To manage resource access by user roles  
   - [ ] To monitor resource performance  
   - [ ] To create virtual networks  

3. **What is a “group” in Azure AD?**  
   - [ ] A collection of resources  
   - [ ] A set of users that can be managed together  
   - [ ] A resource lock configuration  
   - [ ] A subscription setting  

#### Day 3: Implement and Manage Hybrid Identities
1. **What is Azure AD Connect used for?**  
   - [ ] Enabling passwordless authentication  
   - [ ] Syncing on-premises identities with Azure AD  
   - [ ] Managing multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
   - [ ] Creating virtual networks  

2. **Which option allows on-premises identities to be synchronized with Azure AD?**  
   - [ ] Azure Key Vault  
   - [ ] Azure AD Connect  
   - [ ] Conditional Access  
   - [ ] Azure Monitor  

3. **What is a “hybrid identity” in Azure?**  
   - [ ] Identities stored exclusively in Azure AD  
   - [ ] Identities managed only on-premises  
   - [ ] Identities that are synchronized between on-prem and Azure AD  
   - [ ] Identities only for Azure VMs  

#### Day 4: Manage Subscriptions and RBAC
1. **How do you create a custom role in Azure?**  
   - [ ] Through the Azure Portal or PowerShell  
   - [ ] By setting up virtual machines  
   - [ ] Using Azure Monitor  
   - [ ] By configuring VPN gateways  

2. **Why might you use multiple Azure subscriptions?**  
   - [ ] For encryption purposes  
   - [ ] To separate billing and access management by department  
   - [ ] To enforce conditional access policies  
   - [ ] For enhanced storage security  

3. **What does Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allow administrators to do?**  
   - [ ] Set up virtual machines  
   - [ ] Control access to resources within a subscription  
   - [ ] Monitor resource health  
   - [ ] Secure storage accounts with firewalls  

#### Day 5: Governance and Compliance
1. **What is a resource lock in Azure?**  
   - [ ] A setting to encrypt data at rest  
   - [ ] A tool to prevent accidental changes or deletions  
   - [ ] A virtual machine configuration tool  
   - [ ] A type of Azure virtual network  

2. **How does an Azure Blueprint help with governance?**  
   - [ ] It restricts network traffic  
   - [ ] It allows policies, RBAC assignments, and resources to be deployed as a package  
   - [ ] It provides backup and recovery solutions  
   - [ ] It enables user identity synchronization  

3. **What is the difference between Azure Policies and Blueprints?**  
   - [ ] Policies enforce standards; Blueprints include policies, role assignments, and resource groups in a reusable package  
   - [ ] Policies and Blueprints are the same  
   - [ ] Policies monitor usage, and Blueprints monitor security  
   - [ ] Policies manage billing, and Blueprints handle identity management
