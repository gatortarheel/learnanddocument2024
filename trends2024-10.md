# Trends Oct 2024
As we progress through 2024, several key trends are shaping the .NET development landscape:

Perplexity:
## Cross-Platform Development

**.NET MAUI (Multi-Platform App UI)** is gaining significant traction as a cross-platform framework for building native mobile and desktop applications[1][4]. This technology allows developers to create apps for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows using a single shared codebase, streamlining the development process and reducing time-to-market[4].

## Web Development Advancements

**Blazor** continues to revolutionize web development in the .NET ecosystem. This framework enables developers to build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript, leveraging existing .NET skills[2]. Blazor's adoption has seen a 40% increase among .NET developers in 2024, particularly in enterprise web development projects[2].

## Cloud-Native Development

The trend towards cloud-native development is becoming the norm for .NET applications. Gartner estimates that by 2024, over 60% of new .NET applications will be designed as cloud-native[2]. This shift is driven by the benefits of scalability, agility, and cost-effectiveness offered by cloud environments, with Azure being a popular choice for .NET developers[3].

## AI and Machine Learning Integration

The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into .NET applications is rapidly gaining momentum[2][4]. ML.NET and Azure Cognitive Services are enabling developers to incorporate AI functionalities like natural language processing and computer vision into their applications with ease[2].

## Security Enhancements

Security remains a top priority in .NET development. The framework provides robust security features, including cryptography and role-based security implementations[3]. This focus on security makes .NET an attractive choice for businesses concerned about application safety[3].

## Open-Source Adoption

The trend towards open-source is stronger than ever, with over 70% of .NET applications incorporating open-source components in 2024[2]. This shift allows for greater flexibility and community-driven innovation within the .NET ecosystem.

## WebAssembly

WebAssembly is emerging as a significant trend, enabling near-native performance for web-based applications[4]. This technology allows languages like C++ and Rust to run efficiently in modern web browsers, expanding the capabilities of web applications built with .NET[4].

By staying informed about these trends, developers and businesses can leverage the full potential of the .NET framework and maintain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving software development landscape.
